# pico-pollution-sensor
Code for pico pollution sensor project

before code can be used, circuit python / micro python must be installed on the pico. (will confirm which here soon)

data_display.py goes in the pico with the LED display attached.

pollution_sensor.py goes in the pico attached to the pollution sensor.

wiring must be connected up as in display model. (documentation to be added later)
